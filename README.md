# Three.js Scene with AI Character

```
This project demonstrates the integration of a three.js scene with an AI character, leveraging the power of React Three Fiber for rendering and Drei for enhanced Three.js functionalities. The scene showcases advanced 3D graphics techniques and AI-driven character interaction within a web environment.

## Features

- Three.js for 3D graphics rendering.
- React Three Fiber for integrating Three.js with React.
- Drei for additional utilities that simplify Three.js usage with React.
- AI character interaction powered by `@mkkellogg/gaussian-splats-3d and @lumaai/luma-web`.
- Advanced 3D visual effects using Gaussian Splats.
